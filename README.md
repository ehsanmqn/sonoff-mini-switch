#### Sonoff Mini
The Sonoff Mini is, as the name implies, a very small device, designed to be hidden where there's only supposed to be cables. Since it's not supposed to be visible, it's also designed to easily attach an external button.

#### Flashing
Several free GPIO are available. The OTA jumper pin is the most accessible and very easy to use on a pin header.
